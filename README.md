# NEAT-Go
This project is an attempt at creating a more simplistic and performant version of my Java NEAT implementation at https://github.com/JoshuaTrevor/NEAT-Java.

It makes no attempt to render the game locally, and output can instead be viewed by setting the Neural Network output location to the read directory of the React demo here: https://snakeai-joshuatrevor.netlify.app/
